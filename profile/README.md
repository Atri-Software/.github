# Atri Software

**Atri Software** is the independent development space behind [Atri OS](https://github.com/Atri-Software/atri-os) â€” a custom, minimal, and transparent Linux-based operating system built from the ground up.

This organization hosts all components of the Atri OS ecosystem:
- Low-level system initialization
- A custom Wayland UI and shell
- Terminal-based installer
- Lightweight package manager
- Documentation, design assets, and more

## âš¡ Mission

To create a modern, user-controlled operating system with no unnecessary complexity, no hidden behavior, and full architectural transparency.

Atri OS is a hobby-driven, non-commercial project â€” for now.
